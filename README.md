## 📌 About Me

Over the last 18 years, I’ve been committed to growth through education and hard work. I studied at Green Acres Elementary, McLaughlin Middle School, Manchester School of Technology, Manchester Community College, and most recently, **Southern New Hampshire University**.

I'm deeply interested in helping teams succeed through the power of data. I enjoy solving problems, uncovering trends, and creating data visualizations that make complex information easier to understand.

> “My goal is to be part of a company that brings passion to its products and fosters a welcoming, collaborative environment.”

Outside of analytics, I’m a strong multitasker, and someone who thrives on staying busy and learning new things every day.
